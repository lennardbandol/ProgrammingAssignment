# OOP - Assignment Submission - C14337331 - Lennard Glenn Bandol

For my Assignment i will be visualising the SteamData.Csv file that i have created.
It contains the name of the game,the highest peaked amount of players, the link in where the user can buy/download the game.

When you open steamvisual.pde it will open up a menu in which the user can choose an option.
For my assignment I have three option.

The first option is the BarGraph, The user can hover to the BarGraph and it will display the name and the number of players.
Each BarGraph have different colours which was randomized in the steamclass.pde. As the user hover on the one of the bars, 
it will enlarged to let the user clearly see which one hes looking at.

The second option I made a trend graph, it's a bit similar to the BarGraph, the points were also randomized, also as the user
hover on each point, it will enlarge to define clearly which one the user is pointing at, it will also display the details of the
point they're hovering connected with a line. I also added some background images of popular game developers.

For the third option I listed out all the data from the data file, it contains the name,the amount of players,the link to the game
The user can press 1,2,3,4,5,6 to change the pages. as the user hover on the page it will change the row colour in which the mouse
is sitting on, also i added the feature in which the user can click on it then it'll bring the user to the browser where the user 
can buy/download the game from.
