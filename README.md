# OOP - Assignment

For this assignment I used a barGraph,trend graph and an option to list all of the data in the file.
The data was made by myself, it contains the name of a steam game,the highest amount of peaked players and the link to its website.
Theres also a menu option in which the user can just click, theres also an option on the right top corner of each chosen option to go back to the menu.
